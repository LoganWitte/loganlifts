TODO:
    Add 'PATCH' endpoint to '/api/lifts/route' which allows user to update weight, reps, or time
    Add corresponding updateTime() function to '/services/api'
    In '/[exercise]':
        Create form to add a lift, recieves: { weight: number, reps: number, time?: DateTime }
            Requires DateTime form to be created.
        Create graphical display (x -> time, y -> 1RM) for 'userLifts'
            Graph should allow users to click on and edit { weight, reps, time }, or delete a lift.
                Edit form requires usage of same DateTime form as previously.
