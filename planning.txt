Notes:
    Steps to deploy changes to 'schema.prisma':
        1.  'pnpm prisma migrate dev' : Uses schema.prisma to create migration files and update Prisma Client
            1a. 'prisma generate' : Run this before 'next build', already configured in package.json as 'pnpm run build'
        2.  'git commit' : Commits the new migration files
        3.  'pnpm prisma migrate deploy' : Deploys prior migration to DB. This is the DB specified in .env/DATABASE_URL
        4.  'git push' : Deploys migration to production
    Installing dependencies (do once): 'pnpm install'
    Refreshing dependencies (rarely needed): 
        1. delete 'node_modules' and 'pnpm-lock.yaml' (at root directory)
        2. 'pnpm install'
    Running locally: 
        1. 'pnpm run dev' : Starts in development mode
        2. 'pnpm run build', 'pnpm run start' : Starts in production mode, build also finds build errors that could hit production

TODO:
    DONE -> Add 'PATCH' endpoint to '/api/lifts/route' which allows user to update weight, reps, or time
    DONE -> Add corresponding updateTime() function to '/services/api'
    In '/[exercise]':
        Create form to add a lift, recieves: { weight: number, reps: number, isKgs: boolean, time?: DateTime }
            Requires DateTime form to be created.
        Create graphical display (x -> time, y -> 1RM) for 'userLifts'
            Graph should allow users to click on and edit { weight, reps, time }, or delete a lift.
                Edit form requires usage of same DateTime form as previously.
